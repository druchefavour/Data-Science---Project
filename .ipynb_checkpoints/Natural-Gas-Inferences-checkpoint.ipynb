    "### NATURAL GAS PRICES - INFERENCES\n",
    "\n",
    "#### HYPOTHESIS TESTING\n",
    "There is one major major factor that affect natural gas prices in the United States of America. This can be developed in the form of hypothesis: Natural gas prices are mainly a function of market supply and demand. \n",
    "\n",
    "This hypothesis is premised on the thought that there are limited short-term alternatives to natural gas as a fuel for heating and electricity generation during peak demand periods, changes in supply or demand over a short period may result in large price changes. Prices themselves often act to balance supply and demand.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Supply-Side Factors:  These include natural gas production, net imports, and underground storage levels. Increases in supply tend to pull prices down, while decreases in supply tend to push prices up. Increases in prices tend to encourage production, imports, and sales from storage inventories. Declining prices tend to have the opposite effects.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Demand-Side Factors: Factors on the demand-side include weather (temperatures), economic conditions, and petroleum prices. Cold weather (low temperatures) increases demand for heating, while hot weather (high temperatures) increases demand for cooling, which increases natural gas demand by electric power plants. Economic conditions influence demand for natural gas, especially by manufacturers. Demand may be moderated by petroleum fuel prices, which may be an economical substitute for natural gas for power generators, manufacturers, and large building owners. Higher demand tends to lead to higher prices, while lower demand can lead to lower prices. Increases and decreases in prices tend to reduce or increase demand.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### THE INFLUENCE OF WEATHER ON NATURAL GAS PRICES\n",
    "In order to investigate the impact of weather on natural gas prices, we will first create two groups: The group that incorporates prices in the winter & summer (Expected High Demand Period) and the group that incorporates prices in the spring and fall (and Expected Low Demand Period). The winter & summer group are tagged (1) in weather-status variable (WSTAT) while the fall & spring group is labelled (0) in weather-status column.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will first load the data set and then generate a scatter plot to investigate whether there are observed differences between the two groups.  "
